Revision history for Perl extension File::LinearRaid:

0.11	Tue Jun 22 2004
	- Fixed a newline-related bug in test suite that caused it to fail
	  when (length "\n" == 2), as in Windows.
	- Slightly nicer error reporting.
	- Optimizations in SEEK: Only seek() on individual handles if their
	  position is wrong. This is just in case the OS is dumb and clobbers
	  read-ahead buffers on every seek(). I don't know if this is ever the
	  case, but just to be safe... Should help on sequential reads.

0.10	Sat Feb 14 2004
	- Initial release.
